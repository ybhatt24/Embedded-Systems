Smart Adaptive Headlight Dimming System for Safe Road Navigation

Night driving poses significant challenges due to
 reduced visibility and the risk of glare from high-beam
 headlights, which can temporarily blind oncoming drivers or
 pedestrians. This project introduces a Smart Adaptive
 Headlight Dimming System designed to enhance road safety by
 automatically adjusting a vehicle's headlight intensity in real
 time. Powered by an Arduino microcontroller, the system
 utilizes sensors to detect oncoming vehicles, pedestrians, or
 other reflective objects within a predefined range. Upon
 detection, the system intelligently dims the headlights, reducing
 glare and ensuring optimal illumination for both the driver
 and other road users. This adaptive approach not only
 improves visibility but also fosters safer and more comfortable
 driving conditions, minimizing accidents caused by high-beam
 glare. By leveraging compact and cost-effective technology, this
 system provides an innovative solution to a critical road safety
 concern, making it a practical addition to modern vehicles.
